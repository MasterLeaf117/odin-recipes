    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>4 burger buns</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>4 slices cheddar or colby cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 small red onion</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Divide ground beef into 4 even pieces. Roll each piece into a ball; 
                refrigerate until needed. Spread cut sides of each hamburger bun with 
                butter.</li>
            <li>Heat a large cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat 
                (you can add a little vegetable oil if worried about sticking).</li>
            <li>Add two hamburger balls to the skillet. Smash meat flat using the 
                bottom of a small sauce pot or a spatula. Hold in place until seared, 
                about 1 minute; season with salt and pepper. Cook until a good crust 
                forms, then flip.</li>
            <li>Once the flip side looks close to being done, cover with cheese slice. 
                Move the patties aside and place buns, butter side down, in skillet until 
                toasted. Continue to cook burgers until cheese is melted, meat is no longer 
                pink in the center, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted 
                into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>   
            <li>Lay a few onions down on the patty, cover with the top bun and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
